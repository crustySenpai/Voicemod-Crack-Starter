# Voicemod-Crack-Starter
Simple Batch Script to start old Voicemod Cracks where you need to Disable / Enable Internet (obviously no crack included)

Important: If your Adapter Name isn't Ethernet (Check here: "Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change Adapter Settings" and check the Name) then you need to edit the following Lines in the Script:

netsh interface set interface "Ethernet" disable<br/>
and<br/>
netsh interface set interface "Ethernet" enable<br/>
and change the "Ethernet" to your Adapter like "WiFi Private" or whatever it is.

Also if your Voicemod Install Path is a different one than the default you need to change following Line:<br/>
start "" "C:\Program Files\Voicemod Desktop\VoicemodDesktop.exe"<br/>
to whatever Path your Voicemod is installed.
